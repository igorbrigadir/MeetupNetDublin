357|29467849|All Ireland Walking & Activity breaks away|41|open|This group was set up to see how much interest there might be from like minded individuals who may have decent spare time off sometimes weekends free work holidays they may have to take etc who have a bit of a get up and go attitude wouldn t mind a change of scenery doing some walking or cycling in the likes of West Cork Kerry or the West of Ireland with fellow like minded social companions in tow for company and laughs All members should see this group first and foremost as being a decent fun sociable group of individuals not one as having a competitive race to the finish mentality Many of us who could conceivably get away quite often end up not doing so because it s not much fun going on your own Time and time again friends and colleagues who we might like to ask to accompany us on a small break away are understandably tied up with the normal life commitments such as work kids partners etc Then again there may be others that we know too be it another friend or whatever who is usually free from the typical commitments that tie many others down unfortunately Are they normal healthy have the funds to possibly head away with you somewhere different on a weekend Barring the usual weddings funerals important family occasion genuine emergencies so on which we all must contend with as well as being sick from time to time have you perhaps asked this person or indeed more than one person on numerous occasions if they re interested but they always say no You re keen to do something different but are disappointed and left frustrated by others you rely on You just know in your heart of hearts that these people are too set in their ways to ever change or even contemplate giving something different a shot and pushing themselves out of their comfort zone Why should you always have to be at the mercy of dithering negative nellies who hum haw forever over simple break away ideas that you re always putting to them We all know that accomodation prices can rapidly rise the longer you leave it to book And all available accomodation in a given area may just all book out by the time you re waiting around on other indecisive individuals decide to make up their minds Why should you continuously have to put up with the nonsense of being let down time after time again by the same notoriously unreliable folks who come up with the most pathetic cock bull excuses often at the last minute for not going It s the same stick in the mud types that constantly condemn things they ve never tried or a place they ve never actually been as being crap You ll never ever convince some stubborn mules so set in their ways who d rather sit at home alone every weekend watching every Netflix series possible subjecting themselves to 3 hours of Tubridy torture on the gogglebox every Friday night to change Would missing the cup final or the Love Island finale that might happen to be on the telly this weekend be really such a devastating tragedy You can always record them and watch them at a later date if you really must see them Would possibly getting a bit wet mucky be really that bad as opposed to thinking of the benefits of some great exercise in the fresh country air while getting to know some new people in the meantime Of course this is br being melodramatic here but you get the picture Instead of lying idle being bored out of your bracket on your weekend or days off looking for something novel to do why not join us and meet some fresh faces in this group with a similar positive mindset to yourself You ll meet some lively characters get exercise in the fresh air while doing so A chance literally to broaden your horizons by perhaps seeing the lovely sky beyond the majestic Dingle Peninsula or even the sun setting over the tranquil Clew Bay and a night out in popular happening Westport after Who with a get up and go attitude doesn t fancy a weekend away from the same repetitive hustle and bustle in the city and the same old often monotonous scene at the weekends going to the same places seeing the same faces hearing the same annoying songs repeated in the same bars all the time Who doesn t like a welcome change by getting away to the likes of Killarney Dingle West Cork Westport Lahinch Doolin etc taking in the lovely fresh Atlantic air idyllic scenery doing some enjoyable exercise like following marked walking cycling routes etc Going away to such places is a great opportunity to hopefully meet more new and interesting people br MAYBE your future partner awaits who knows WHO SAYS the chances of finding somebody are just limited to coming from only a fellow group member either br and not to mention enjoying the craic music and the laughter in the evenings too with a few well earned post walk cycle drinks in the local pubs It takes a lot to beat the likes of a well earned stew and a few pints in the pub afterwards enjoying the banter in a lively pub in Kerry or Clare after a good day spent rambling out in the cold So if you re open minded have a positive willingness to try something different from the norm sometimes are able to travel and stay overnights if you can love getting some exercise in the fresh air are sociable and love meeting new people then this group may well be worth trying Nothing in life is certain except the obvious taxes death if we re being philosophical Will this group be any good In a nutshell honestly it may or may not be who knows Isn t it better to at least give something a try rather than not bothering your barney at all There is no magic wand that can be waved here to say it will be amazing It all comes down to the members and how willing they are to put their enthuasism into it and the interaction between members Might there be other members you won t like and get on with Quite possibly yes In all walks of life particularly with large groups of strangers involved there ll always be people who you will naturally gel with and others you don t one bit The same goes for everyone For instance who doesn t see different personalities clash in their workplace It doesn t mean that you can t enjoy yourself nor should you compromise your plans because someone who you don t like or get on with is present You can still be tolerant and polite to someone and agree to disagree when necessary in small doses without having to pretend to be best buddies just because you re walking beside each other Why let that someone you don t especially like prevent you from possibly ruining your chance of having a good break away or even stop you from going away altogether One thing is for certain though You ll never broaden your mind horizons etc nor will you realistically meet anyone new potentially interesting acting like a recluse at home alone It s not unreasonable to expect anyone who joins the group to be able to manage up to 6 or 7 hours a day walking on moderate tracks with some hills or marked cycle tracks If equipped with the right gear I don t mind a bit of light rain when walking If the wind rain was say to become absolutely atrocious on a group walk for example then obviously common sense will prevail and we ll DECIDE COLLECTIVELY AS A GROUP either to turn back or not venture out in the first place Nobody wants to see anybody else ending up with pneumonia in hospital for the sake of stupid pig headed stubborness over a social walk We re always going to be at the mercy of what the Irish weather throws at us It may be blatantly obvious to most members but it needs to be stated nonethless that No organiser nor any other group member is responsible if any member heads away with this group the weather turns out to be very inclement Nobody is forcing anyone else to go We re all adults have the freedom to exercise our own judgements with regard to the weather forecasted make our own decisions accordingly I m sure though that in the event of bad weather cancelling a walk all members will be resourceful enough to find other alternative things to amuse and occupy themselves with There may be some experienced group members who might be better able to advise the other group members on the gear needed aside from the obvious basic things like hiking boots shoes raingear jacket thermals outdoor rucsac sunhat compass maps food water etc Even as an organiser I d like to have some sort of consensus that everyone s opinion is heard before suggesting locations for trips away as in picking places walks that at least appeal to a good few members and not just one or two I ve been looking at modest 5 to 6 hour walks around fantastic locations such as the Sheepshead Peninsula in County Cork plus the Dingle Peninsula The Westport to Achill Island Greenway cycle route is another obvious option too Westport is a busy vibrant lively town as anyone who has been there will know I want to make the level of difficulty on the suggested walks cycles etc as moderate or easy as possible for everyone to enjoy it Without wanting to sound any way smug or come across like a pompous smart a e I m not a clairvoyant mind reader so I can t try to run a group effectively to keep members interested if I don t have even an inkling as to what the members tastes are what people like or don t like I m sure anyone who has experience in organising meetups will concur with me on this Thus please don t be shy about speaking up and voicing your opinions and suggestions ideas etc In any group situation it s uniquely rare that every person is happy with everything proposed and suggested For example in many remote locations in Ireland do bear in mind there may be no 4 star hotels to be pampered in or gourmet restaurants to dine out in close proximity so pub food and local pub or basic B B accomodation may be the only options if you wish to come on certain walks Other information that d be helpful to find out from ye members is Are some places too far from mainstream towns where some members can get a bus or train to and meet up with other members who may have driven down and lift share from that point Do ye mind traveling say an hour or hour and a half even further far past Cork city or Killarney or would ye prefer to pick more modest shorter walks with less driving time back to the Greater Dublin area if this is where most of ye may be commuting to from I can think of lots of short walks say around towns like Kinsale 25mins drive from Cork city etc which are closer to Dublin than remote West Cork Certainly after a long drive down from Dublin I m sure that nobody would want to face more than a 20 or 30 minute drive if staying in hotel hostel b b accomodation on a Friday night for example before even starting out a walk or a cycle say on a Saturday so common sense will dictate where we might stay in relation to the walks or where walks could start in relation to what accomodation options are possible and available at that given time in the area of the suggested activity There are a good few walk locations that if planned well would allow us to literally walk out from your accomodation after breakfast to commence walking with no driving that morning required Handy for those feeling a bit ropey or nursing a sore head One example say of a possible no driving needed on morning of walk location is the lovely picturesque Durrus village on the Sheepshead Peninsula in West Cork is a village where you can start a good length walk on foot from Other kind of trips that could be arranged could entail hiring bikes for those of us that don t have the means to transport one to complete the Westport to Achill Island Greenway in County Mayo staying in Westport etc or even trying the Waterford Greenway The reviews rave about this cycle route as the entire section is safely off main roads on a protected track unlike sections of the Westport to Achill Island Greenway which isn t as I witnessed myself Even trying surfing in somewhere like Lahinch or Bundoran is an option for those of us who have never done it or only gone a few times like myself and willing to try it again I ve no doubt that most if not all of us are all trying to watch the s we spend within reason of still enjoying having a good night or weekend away Many members thus may have slightly different budgets so everyone is free to book their own accomodation and mutually organise share with other members should they so wish If the cost of even the most basic accomodation options makes a suggested or scheduled walk unviable due to ridiculous prices that walk will be cancelled and either a new walk location will be proposed or no walk will take place for that date Places like West Cork and Kerry are way too far to consider going just for the day without staying at least one overnight unless you are lucky enough to have the means to access a private helicoptor What has to be taken into consideration is any festivals or big events going on in an area that will dramatically impact on the cost and availability of be accomodation It would of course be preferable for all members of a group meeting up for any post walk food evening drinks if members going were all staying in accomodation in close proximity to where we ve arranged say to go for dinner drinks etc Nobody wants the additional hassle of unnecessary extra driving on a weekend break in addition to the basic commute down and back to Dublin or wherever if at all possible Nobody wants the nightmare scenario either of sometimes of trying to find and organise a last minute taxi when staying in a remote location miles away from a local town or village say where most of the group are staying and will be meeting up later on You can t properly enjoy a decent drink or two either if you have to take your car to the pub restaurant unless you are a non drinker It goes without saying also that there is no issue with anyone who isn t a drinker pioneer from joining the group Everyone is free to do their own thing make what they want out of the group and mix in whatever way they choose to enjoy themselves and just be themselves That s what a meetup group is all about I d encourage members to get to know other members not least for the purpose of car pooling splitting travel costs which always helps especially for those members who don t currently have a car or those who don t drive Nobody wants to be left out of pocket or taken for a mug either I don t think it s unreasonable thus for one member offering another member a lift down say from Dublin etc to say Kerry or Dublin to Galway to be expected to be offered to be reimbursed for at least a reasonable split of the estimated petrol diesel plus tolls cost or a fair amount that both parties agree on Agree it amongst who you may be travelling with as to what is deemed fair Nobody likes to have to ask or chase somebody up later to cough up the dough money if they offer someone a lift and the other person conveniently forgets to pay or who doesn t make arrangments to pay later on say if they need to go to an ATM to get cash for example It causes embarassment having to chase people up to be reimbursed plus it can often cause resentment too Try to avoid this situation by not taking advantage of another member s offer of a favour or good turn to you Believe me that it s far quicker and cheaper to travel with someone else by car if possible if you don t have a car yourself The more the merrier and share and split say costs of 40 50 fuel usage estimated if on a Dublin to Westport return trip with a 3hr 3hr 30 min estimated average drive time even say it s 60 fuel used that s 30 each compared to the slower 4 hour train that costs up to 75 for a one adult return ticket if bought at the last minute Plus the trains are often packed to the rafters offering no comfort The Kerry train from Dublin can cost 90 100 for a return ticket if booked last minute at peak times That s a big painful whopping 100 spent before the fun begins Plus you may need to pay for an additional taxi from train station too to get you to your accomodation The train say is also only an option if the group are staying in a town like Killarney or Westport where there are stations or unless another member is willing to collect you say from the train station in Killarney or Tralee to bring you on out to Dingle say if a group outing happened to be on there I m sure ye all have had enough of me harping on here now so it s time for me to just about zip it and say A warm welcome to the group certainly don t hesitate to get stuck right in and your comments and suggestions Let s make this work REGARDS Eoghan Group Organiser|2018-08-07|['Socializing']

and most beautiful gifts to ourselves and our loved ones At its most basic just showing up and being willing to touch someone with the intention of bringing healing or love can be a comforting experience for another And sometimes it s as easy as that We may shy away from placing soothing hands on an aching back or stroking a tense head thinking drugs or a doctor are more efficient or not wanting to spend the time Surprisingly though it can be all that s needed to shift a mood lighten discomfort or unlock a deeper emotional layer that s ready to be cleared More importantly touch connects people and increases that sense of trust and love in the world in a way that doctors and drugs struggle to do Freya Watson via elephant journal CUDDLEMONIALS Below are what some past Cuddle participants had to say about their experiences I love this cuddle space so safe and soft 3 L S I LOVE THESE CUDDLE PARTIES Thank you so much They make me smile inside and out W S These cuddle parties are a celebration of touch and relaxation with nice therapeutic music friendly faces and consent a constant presence like a meditation of touch and comfort Friendships are made and hugs cuddles release a lovely helping of the happy love hormone that combats depression and our moods Too many people live with no touch no hugs no love you don t need relationships to receive this affection K F People really need to start realising understanding the importance of touch in this harsh world People need to learn to have the strength to be comfortable confident enough to set their own boundaries and to be able to ask for what they want what they need Cuddle Parties are perfect for this Everyone should attend at least one I believe those who resist most need to attend the most Please put it on your bucket list It is an amazing uplifting experience J B I think this is something special I have managed to reconnect with myself and communicate my needs and understand other s needs more clearly through the training I received at the 3 cuddle party s I have attended so far I look forward to many more Thank you from the bottom of my heart S K Thanks Randy for your input and guidance is very inspiring The Cuddle Salon is amazing T M Thanks a million for a lovely first ever Cuddle Party experience I greatly appreciate how you took the time to make me feel welcome and accommodated and especially when you described the staircase for me a few weeks ago so that I would know what to expect I thought you accommodated for my disability very well and much much better than most people do I thought you did a great job creating and maintaining a safe space for everyone and that the welcome circle exercises were extremely useful I found that people were so kind and patient Today I got to practice giving consent as well as saying no and I think that the entire experience was very therapeutic for me I m already planning on coming to the next one and many more after that I plan to be a regular attendee The vibes in the room were so nice and many of the conversations I had were almost as good as the cuddles Thanks again for all you do to run a fantastic event S S Great day really enjoyed it thanks for creating a great space J F I had heard about the cuddle party at first online and said I d never be brave enough to try it I didn t want work or family to ever hear I was into something weird so different I then met someone who had tried it and explained it to me It was a chance to try having my boundaries verbally instead of using body language as my main tool I asked for what I wanted and said no to what I didn t want It was a pure joy to be there I was high on oxytocin and made some great connections in the cuddling chats like pillow talk without the sex At the end our group went into spontaneous group sing alongs to the fabulous music that Randy had playing We were so joyful like little kids On an even deeper level I noticed that the shame feelings of wanting love and connection I experienced released and started healing There was some sadness in the days after about my beliefs that wanting touch and connection was codependent and not good for me This was a safe space to get a dose of what we all need Human touch I will definitely be back F M I feel so blessed to have been a part of this It s a really precious gift you are offering and a beautiful space that you hold I love the mixture of playfulness and depth and have found the three Cuddly Parties that I ve been to deeply nourishing With hugs gratitude L R Yesterday was a beautiful experience I had never in attended anything like this before I met gentle spirits incarnate who showed care It was most professional It was friendly its was a joy experience I felt NO invasion of my space my space was nourished Each individual showed care and respect I was on cloud nine E Thank you so very much to all people who attended today This was my first Cuddle party and I had no idea how I would like it I am so much happier after the party I had a tough time the last few years and much hurts After coming today I feel that i opened my heart again and i feel better than I have felt in the last few years I needed this warmth and kindness of people and hugs so VERY much Thank you so much my heart is healing With love many cuddles A J A very special experience on so many levels Thank you M C I was quite touched by the event I m doing lots of things differently since then I wake up earlier I m doing what I enjoy and not doing what I don t I m doing yoga differently by watching my muscles doing the work and by loving my body which is an interesting new feeling I feel it because I experienced what it feels like to be loved I m watching movies differently by rewinding and watching touching scenes over and over I m walking slowly I just experience a different life N S I really enjoyed the last cuddle party I met a great mix of people from several countries and backgrounds I now feel more confident to ask for what I want and to be more playful in the introduction and practice of rules I am seeing how much my need for touch is not met in my ordinary daily life and how much of an empty space this unmet need creates Cuddle Party Ireland is an accepting friendly trusting warm place in which to explore my need for touch and how this resonates with other participants I am heartened that all participants can check in with themselves and respond with Yes or No genuinely I left feeling happy and relaxed after a truly enjoyable afternoon I ll definitely come to another cuddle party My warmest thanks for the clear and friendly way in which you hold the space for all of us A B Thank you so much for the most fantastic loving peaceful encounter at yesterday s Cuddle Party I am filled with profound thankfulness and gratitude My state of mind is forever altered C L Thank you for yesterday The Cuddle Party really made me take a good look at myself and how I interact with others I will be processing that over the coming days I floated peacefully into 2017 thank you for the beautiful cuddles M H It was just what I needed L H Thank you for organizing this safe space where a person can clearly ask for what they want and receive feedback P D This was a very special one for me I felt that I was really heard and accepted and given permission to say No and that it was ok I notice that I am often feeling very nervous at the beginning of cuddle parties but when I do honour my wishes of not wanting to hug someone by saying No and letting go of judgements of that I feel safe It s as if when I realise that I have the permission and power to choose the right interaction for me I put myself at ease And then I end up relaxing completely and by the end of yesterdays workshop I felt softer gentler happier and also stronger and safer in myself Another thing I find that is that I can often be concerned about whether the other person is OK that I m not in the moment and enjoying I also then don t know what I really want because I m off elsewhere It was really good to hear it said out loud that we are capable of looking after ourselves It was empowering and also relieving I didn t have to worry about the other person and whether they wanted to stop cuddling W S A wonderful afternoon with a lovely welcoming group Looking forward to next month s Cuddle Salon F M Thank you for being there and creating this fabulous space and opportunity for touch starved souls to connect I had a wonderful experience was so cozy and happy snuggled up with a partner The biggest thing I learned from the Irish Cuddle Salon is to become secure with establishing boundaries To have the chance to try them out in such a safe environment is really fortunate M C Beautiful moving fun Cuddle Salon Thank you P W Yesterday s cuddle salon brought out the more loving side of me I really enjoyed it It showed me the critical need for physical closeness that we all have J K Highly recommended safe space for practising how to bring more human connection to our lives P M Thanks Randy I had a great day anonymous It was my first time to go to one last month and it was a really wonderful experience It was a really safe and welcoming space to be I learned so much about human interaction and communication boundaries consent it all felt so natural to me I know I have more to learn and what a beautiful way to spend a Sunday or any afternoon A N Great experience warm and enriching A really nice event Can t wait for the next one N X Nice honest open L G Thank you for a wonderful time Relaxing loving and nurturing E S I m still feeling the effects of it today such a beautiful experience thank you everybody A R I had a truly wonderful time at yesterday s cuddle party The transition from the warm up exercises to the actual cuddle session was so easy and organic It was a really lovely group and I m extremely grateful to have physically and emotionally connected with some beautiful kind and open people I was quite depressed at the weekend and it took a real effort for me to get up and out but I m so glad I did It s hard to describe how I felt leaving but it was a hugely positive feeling Thank you C M I at first thought it was a bit unnecessary to describe how to say No and Yes but later on realised it was actually much more complex and useful than I thought Anonymous I was apprehensive not knowing what to expect but really enjoyed it The structure and clear exercises made it easy so I was able to relax I felt I gained something vital A great enjoyable experience that left me yearning for more N Yes cuddling with strangers is awkward at first But we re all people we all need touch and affirmation and love After a minute or two the cuddling gets comfortable and cozy because you are soon no longer in a room full of strangers This is a positive shame free space to get important needs met You ll feel better mentally and physically after a good snuggle M D Definitely would do it again So much food for thought discussion Anonymous I grew up in a hands off touch deprived atmosphere Cuddling changed my life Attending cuddle events I met my partner made wonderful friends and helped create heart centered touch positive community cuddling helped me realize I was lovable worthy of giving and receiving loving human touch S S I used to spend 60 per week on massage and now I have friends with whom I can share different types of touch K R Cuddling taught me that touch is as infinite as colour or music Cuddling taught me that compassionate touch can be as powerful for emotional healing as talk therapy or antidepressants Cuddling taught me that desire for sex and desire for touch are two different things A K As a woman without a partner whose primary love language is physical touch I find cuddling one of the best ways to feel connected to myself and others in a safe way I ve made great friendships along the way too C A Even though I m a teacher I sometimes have social anxiety Well facilitated cuddles have helped me to relax and connect without feeling the need to have a couple of drinks to loosen up Also becoming more touch positive has helped me come through times of stress loss or uncertainty with a more robust sense of resilience M M Cuddles have had an enriching effect on my life Growing up middle class it was taboo to touch people I recall even having this fear of brushing up against my friends or strangers But as I opened myself up to different cultural modes of thought I explored such things as cuddles and found that touching and being touched in a controlled environment is quite liberating and much needed G B Cuddling has made it possible for me to go much longer without a boyfriend so that I can be more choiceful in my romantic relationships K R Cuddling helped ease my chronic pain enriched my recovery from surgery by soothing my parasympathetic nervous system lowering my cortisol levels E G Beautiful I appreciate the effort and care put into it the comfy blankets and pillows the gourmet snacks and of course the smiles and support C D Really enjoyable and interesting P I have been now to six cuddle parties in a row They all have been intense lovely experiences with the single downside that Mondays are tough as I get something like a cuddle party hangover I accept that as well as the energising effect that I get for the rest of the week More than just fun I am realising that these parties have become a means to learn about relating and about myself so there are benefits that carry into my life outside the parties Moreover my cuddling with each person is like a little story and the story can develop if the other person comes to another party and we cuddle again This opens some interesting possibilities with respect to depth of relating In a nutshell it is great to come to a single party or even to the odd party but for maximum benefit I recommend that cuddlers come to every party A M Peaceful and Nourishing Anonymous I need MOAR P J Gorgeous P B A great experience Everyone should try it B H Really enjoyed the boundary setting I feel like if I went to another event it would be of great benefit Anonymous Spectacular M M I can t even begin to describe how soothed I felt after it C G Appreciated the clear explanation of the rules and the examples to aid their understanding Anonymous I have attended two of Randy s Cuddle Parties now and feel like so many people would benefit from this way of reconnecting with people in a real physical way Being at the Cuddle Party was nerve wracking at first but by the end I found myself wishing it would never end Randy creates a safe space where consent and respect are tantamount and there is no pressure whatsoever to do anything you don t want to do including cuddling The result is this safe cocoon of warmth healing and understanding a place from which you can explore and practice asking for what you want without judgement It really is an amazing way to spend a Sunday afternoon and a wonderful gift to yourself I would definitely recommend the experience to anyone D F I really enjoyed the way the space was set up and the progression of the night Anonymous Very much appreciate the lack of pressure to cuddle touch It made me think about my own boundaries a lot very therapeutic I would like to go again to explore my boundaries more next time Anonymous You sprayed us all with oxytocin I couldn t believe how at home and relaxed I felt there Thank you for this incredible process that you facilitate P Surprisingly good T I really like this and felt I could have explored it further but really appreciated that I was given the space to decide myself what my boundaries would be Anonymous Yet again a lovely experience Very different to the first time I attended yet the experience still managed to soothe the soul while positively re directing my perspective C G Amazing experience Anonymous Beautiful A So important for my relationship with my body first to realise I m so scared of potential refusal and of acceptance too then to see it s not all that scary and that it s not true my body is repelling to everyone willing to cuddle me Thank you K I was pretty nervous when attending my first ever Cuddle Party with Randy I need not have worried From the very first moments I felt at ease and open to whatever would happen Randy holds the space with warmth clarity openness and includes all possible options for participants He invites people to join as much as they wish and we had a chance to practise consenting or refusing actions This meant that whatever happened to me I had either asked for it and knew that the other person agreed freely OR I knew that I agreed freely to what I had been asked This made me feel completely safe and trusted the other participants This was a gentle light and colourful space in which to enjoy the basic human need for touch and contact in a relaxed way and the boundaries were stated very clearly I would recommend Randy s Cuddle Parties to anyone and reassure anyone that they can be at ease People can ask questions and Randy supports everyone warmly R B A big thank you for the opportunity to discover healthy non sexual touch To me there is nothing wrong with it it s so nurturing Anonymous As relaxing an atmosphere as it could be being able to chat and cuddle with people was fun nice despite my social discomforts I like the people who were there Now that I ve dipped my toes in I d like to try it again ya J B Great afternoon lovely time and beautiful people M B Thanks for organising that beautiful event which attracted so many wonderful people It was a real treat J N Getting to experience human kindness and authenticity restores my faith in humanity Group cuddles may be my new church I worship every one of you who is brave enough to join me Thank you I am humbled What an amazing evening S H Yesterday was amazing for me I d been emotionally closed and while wanting wife and family couldn t even see myself being intimate with anyone again I am still stunned by how open I am now After the cuddle party my heart and mind are open and I feel softer I m loving again Thank you A G|2015-04-20|['Health & Wellbeing', 'Support']

537|19876616|Osho Kundalini Meditation and Discussions with Ravi|170|open|What is Osho Kundalini Meditation Kundalini meditation is a powerful technique developed by Osho to support our ability to enjoy and celebrate our own natural being Just sitting is not easy for us But when we compliment stillness with active meditation we move naturally from action to relaxation What are the stages of Osho Kundalini Meditation Kundalini meditation is structured into four clear stages and lasts for an hour The first 3 stages are with music and the last one is in silence It moves from shaking breathing through catharsis and letting go to channeling the energy and leading finally to stillness First Stage 15 minutes of loosening up and shaking the body feeling the energies moving up from the feet Eyes open or closed let the shaking happen and become it don t will it If you force it it will become an exercise a bodily physical exercise Then the shaking will be there but just on the surface it will not penetrate you You will remain solid stone like rock like within You will remain the manipulator the doer and the body will just be following The body is not the question you are the question When I say shake I mean your solidity your rock like being should shake to the very foundations so that it becomes liquid fluid melts flows And when the rock like being becomes liquid your body will follow Then there is no shake only shaking Then nobody is doing it it is simply happening Then the doer is not Osho Second Stage 15 minutes of dancing any way you feel letting the whole body move as it wishes Again your eyes can be open or closed Third Stage For 15 minutes close your eyes and be still sitting or standing observing witnessing whatever is happening inside and out Fourth Stage Keeping your eyes closed for 15 minutes lie down and be still Click here to get an idea of what the meditation entails After we complete the stages we sit together for a question and answer session with Ravi Why this approach We have repressed so many things that it is difficult to go to the source of our being because our repression is the barrier Kundalini meditation creates space for our repression to surface and express themselves creating a natural inner harmony which allows us to experience authentic stillness Surprise Yourself In this meditation you will be surprised by what is inside you when you allow the craziness of the mind to surface and express itself then melting with the divine happens naturally Who can come No experience is needed we start from the beginning and the practices will be introduced carefully About Ravi Ravi has been inspired by Osho teaching and wishes to share this wisdom with others Ravi has been guiding a Osho Kundalini Meditation group in Dublin for the past five years with a small group of people and now he wishes to offer this meditation to a wider group of people Please visit www ravipurdasy com for more information on Ravi Where Ravi plans to offer Kundalini meditation at Dublin City Bikram Yoga 56 58 Drury Street Floor 2 Dublin 2 Google Maps link|2016-04-24|['Health & Wellbeing', 'Support']

1086|19831862|Dublin Awakening Breathwork Meetup|126|open|Awakening breathwork is an embodied healing practice using three types and stages of breathwork in sequence Opening Connecting and Integrating It is offered in group and individual sessions MORE ABOUT AWAKENING BREATHWORK A typical one hour breathwork session is divided into three stages each with a different kind of breathwork all done in a lying down position with the aid of a cushion pillow and blanket for comfort These three stages are OPENING This is a simplicity approach to breathing just noticing the breath without trying to do anything with it or change it Allowing the breath to be as it wants and simply being aware of the body and environment A basic mindful approach to the experience in the moment This phase helps to open the practice and come fully into the present and into awareness of your body and environment This is done for 10 minutes CONNECTING In this second stage the breathing shifts to a technique known as conscious connected breathing aka rebirthing breathwork This consists of inhaling consciously into the upper chest area and quickly releasing the breath without pausing or holding on to the breath As the breath is released you immediately inhale again without pausing or holding at the end of the exhale In this way there is a continuous cycle maintained of inhaling and exhaling without gaps This is done consciously and with awareness resisting the temptation to space out or go asleep This is a deep part of the practice which encourages healing in the body by releasing energy that has become blocked or stored in the body as cellular memory Painful emotional experiences from the past which have solidified in the body can be released during this phase The conscious connected breathing technique helps the thinking mind to get out of the way and allow the body to get on with healing itself This phase is continued for 30 minutes INTEGRATING For the last stage of the practice you change the breathing pattern to one of deep relaxation breathing This consists of slow deep breathing into the abdominal area slowly inhaling and filling the abdomen like a balloon and then slowly releasing the breath The emphasis is on gentleness and relaxation and its fine to pause and adjust the pace as feels natural Rounding off the practice this way helps to integrate the experience relaxing any anxiety that may have come up during the previous stage of conscious connected breathing and helping body and mind become synchronised and balanced This is done for the final 20 minutes of the practice|2016-04-12|['Health & Wellbeing', 'Support']
